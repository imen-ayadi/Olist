# Olist Brazil - Sales Insights and Predictions
## Project Overview:
This project focuses on the analysis of sales data from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce company. The main objectives include developing insightful dashboards and applying machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.

# Business Understanding:
Olist connects sellers with online marketplaces in Brazil. The challenge was to extract actionable insights from sales data to drive growth and improve customer retention.

# Key Objectives:
### ETL Process: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading using Talend.
Dashboard Development: Visualize sales performance using Power BI.
Machine Learning: Predict customer satisfaction using algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and XGBoost.
# Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and feature engineering were performed on the sales dataset. Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded.
